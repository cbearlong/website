In light of the coronavirus crisis, String Phenomenology 2020 will be held virtually from 
June 8 - 12, 2020. The conference will be held for a few hours per day in order to allow
for maximum participation across the globe. All presentations will be by junior researchers
who are not yet in permanent positions. 

A schedule will appear in the last two weeks of
May, 2020.  

Please register to receive links for 
viewing the presentations.

String Phenomenology 2021 will be hosted at Northeastern University, and we hope to see you there.
